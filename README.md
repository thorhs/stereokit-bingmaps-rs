This is a Template project for <https://github.com/MalekiRe/stereokit-rs> that enables a quick setup for a quest-compatiable stereokit-project!

To run on android run `cargo apk run`
Make sure that you

- Have `cargo-apk` installed with `cargo install cargo-apk`
- Have `rustup target add aarch64-linux-android` to install rust for the quest android version

Good luck!
